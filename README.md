# Lucian Carrel - Portfolio

Website created as a portfolio. 

## Problem:
We needed to highlight the expertise of the artist, the plays of lights and shadows present in his photography and also make it SEO friendly, so people can get in touch with Lucian.

## Solution:
We used the React environment and Tailwind for faster development and good performance. Also, we used NextJS for the SEO part.

## Results:

## Details

For the layout we worked with a 6 column display, this helps keeping the spaces and make the design more eye-catchy. This was really helpful in the projects section of the home page, as we needed to keep the same space units.

In the hero and main titles of the page we added some text animations, making the experience more appealing and easy to remember, while keeping the navigation easy and not bloated with moving elements. The animations were made with `requestAnimationFrame()`.
